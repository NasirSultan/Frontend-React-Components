* Reusable components with typed props
* State management with type safety
* Custom hooks with generic support
* Interface and union usage for better structure

## Project Structure

* `components/`: Contains reusable UI components
* `hooks/`: Contains custom hooks with types
* `types/`: Contains shared TypeScript types
* `App.tsx`: Main component to run the example
* `index.tsx`: Entry point of the application

## What This Project Shows

1. How to pass props with interfaces
2. How to use `useState` with specific types
3. How to create custom hooks with types and generics
4. How to use union types for limited allowed values
5. How to keep your code organized and type-safe

## How to Run

1. Make sure Node.js is installed
2. Run `npm install` to install packages
